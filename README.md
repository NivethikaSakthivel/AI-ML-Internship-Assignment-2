# Automated Flight Booking System

This project is an automated chatbot system for booking flights, which utilizes a Flask backend for handling flight search and booking functionalities, Gradio for the user interface, and ngrok for exposing the Flask app publicly.

## Features:
- **Search Flights:** Users can search for available flights by providing their origin, destination, and travel date.
- **Book Flight:** After selecting a flight, users can book their flight, and a booking confirmation with a reference is provided.
- **Email Confirmation:** A confirmation email is sent to the user after booking a flight.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** The system uses a Gradio-based chatbot interface to interact with users, making it easy to search and book flights.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: A web framework to handle the backend logic for flight search and booking.
- **Gradio**: A Python library for creating the user interface and handling user input.
- **ngrok**: A service that exposes the Flask app to the internet for external access.
- **SMTP (Email Service)**: For sending booking confirmation emails to users.

## Setup and Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-flight-booking-system.git
   cd automated-flight-booking-system
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up ngrok for public access:
   - Follow the [ngrok setup instructions](https://ngrok.com/docs) and get your auth token.
   - Run the following command to set up ngrok:
     ```bash
     !ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
     ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the public URL generated by ngrok to interact with the flight booking system.

## Usage:
1. The chatbot prompts the user to input their travel details (e.g., origin, destination, and date).
2. The chatbot then shows available flights and prompts the user to select a flight.
3. Once a flight is selected, the system books the flight and sends a confirmation email to the user.

## Example:
```
User: "New York to Los Angeles on October 15th"
Bot: "Here are the available flights:
Flight 1: Airways A - 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM - $150
Flight 2: Airways B - 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM - $180
Please select a flight by typing the flight number."
```
